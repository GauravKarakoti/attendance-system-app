# Face Attendance System App

Welcome to the **Face Attendance System App**! This Python-based application uses **InsightFace** for facial recognition and **Streamlit** for an intuitive, user-friendly interface. Developed by **Harsh Vaidya**, this project aims to revolutionize attendance management through advanced facial recognition technology.

We encourage open-source contributions to help make this project even better! ðŸš€

## About the Project

The Face Attendance System App is designed to automate attendance tracking using **facial recognition technology**. It is ideal for use in various settings like classrooms, offices, and events where attendance management is required. The system simplifies the attendance process by accurately identifying individuals based on their facial features.

## Features

- **Real-Time Facial Recognition:** Utilizes the powerful **InsightFace** library for high-accuracy facial recognition.
- **Streamlit Interface:** An interactive, simple, and user-friendly web-based interface.
- **Redis Integration:** Fast and efficient data storage and retrieval for smooth real-time performance.
- **Open Source:** We welcome contributions from developers worldwide to enhance and expand the project.

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

To get started, first clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/harsh432004/attendance-system-app

1. Navigate to the Project Directory
Once the repository is cloned, change your current directory to the project folder:

bash
Copy code
cd attendance-system-app
2. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python dependencies by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
This will install all the libraries specified in the requirements.txt file, including dependencies like Streamlit, InsightFace, and others.

3. Run the Application
